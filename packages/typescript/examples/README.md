# Examples

Each file is a self-contained, type-checked function you can copy into an app.
`pnpm typecheck` compiles them against the SDK, so an API change that breaks
an example fails CI instead of drifting from the docs. These will move into the
Hardcover docs site pages as each resource lands there.
